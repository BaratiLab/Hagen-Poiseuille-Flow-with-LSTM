# Hagen-Poiseuille-Flow-with-LSTM

This tutorial outlines how to model developing Hagen-Poiseuille flow with LSTM using Python in
Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to train an LSTM model to predict a timme series of developing
velocity profiles given only boundary condi∆üons of the flow. The tutorial is divided into 4 parts:
1. Package installation
2. Review of developing Hagen-Poiseuille flow and LSTM
3. Data Preparatioon
4. Development of LSTM Model
